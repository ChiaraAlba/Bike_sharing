    "Bike sharing has rapidly become a popular means of public transport in modern cities. Its benefits are numerous, including improved health and fitness for the users, decreased congestion on the road networks of the cities, and decreased environmental and pollutive impact from the more conventional means of public transport which rely on fossil fuels. Cycling is also widely considered to be fun! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to meet these needs and promote these benefits many companies have sprung up that offer a systematised bike-sharing service. All have a fleet of bicycles available for the customers, but deployal comes in two forms: from fixed stations with locking docking points, or on a \"pick-up-drop-off\" principle, where the user parks the bike in any accessible location for the next user to find it. Whilst the flexibility of the latter offers many benefits, we will focus on the former for our following experiments. We will use the [Capital Bike Sharing data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) based around metropolitan District Columbia, USA, which are freely available from Capital's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem for users of bike-sharing systems such as Capital's is being able to find a bike and/or a docking station when you need one. For example during the morning rush-hour, commuters to work might find that earlier users have already snapped up all the bikes. After eventually locating a bike and cycling to work, they might find that all the docking stations near their work are already full up from the earlier commuters. This can make usage of the system quite tricky and annoying! And of course the same problems apply to the evening homeward commute...\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to find patterns in usage, by applying techniques from machine learning (ML). Moreover we will attempt to predict demands (of bikes/spaces) at the stations, which a company could use to artificially reposition the bikes so as to better meet the users' requirements."
